# Process Document

This document outlines the process of how we got from concept to prototype.

1. We started off by meeting and discussing an idea for a game that would be an educational game for kids that would involve teaching kids the Maori language.
2. Once we had settled on this idea, Josh (Design Student) created a level for us to start working on.  I then implemented a respawn mechanic that would make the player respawn whenever they hit the floor block.
3. I then decided to create a main menu that the player would be presented with when first running the game.  This has a Play, Options and Quit button.  The Options button has a volume slider which currently does nothing to the volume.
4. We then got some feedback from Simon about the game and the one level we had.  He said that the level was far too hard and that creating a few tutorial levels would help immensely with the gameplay.  
5. Josh went and created some simpler levels for the player to learn on and I made a checkpoint system for the player.  This was the hardest part of the development and it also took the longest.  
6. Once this was completed, I decided to make a game over screen that would be displayed if the player managed to beat all of the levels.  This is a very simple menu and the colours do not match with the game.
7. We then got some more feedback about changing the speed of the player and making the collision detection and movement use a different algorithm to make it cleaner and less janky.
